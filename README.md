![Android on Kobo Glo](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/77eadadf-ce7f-46e7-a910-b2493bf226c7)
<p></p>
This project is based on open source projects (Android, Linux Kernel, Android Apps)

# What you need
- A small card to open the kobo back cover
- Kobo Glo
- PC
- Micro SD card reader (If your pc doesn't have one)
- Brain
# Instructions
## Opening the kobo
To open the kobo just start prying on the back cover with a small card (bus card if not so big)
After you got the cover off get the Micro SD out of the kobo
## Backup image
Here are the instructions **CREATE A IMAGE BEFORE DOING ANYTHING** put the kobo micro sd in your computer and create a kobo image with this software: [Image Creator](https://github.com/lori28167/android-koboglo/releases/download/main/USB.Duplicator.Image.Creator.exe)
## Android install
you need to put the micro sd in your computer and download those two files: [Android Image](https://github.com/lori28167/android-koboglo/releases/download/main/kobo-android.img) [Image Flasher](https://github.com/lori28167/android-koboglo/releases/download/main/USB.Duplicator.Image.Writer.exe)
Then open the program and select the image you downloaded. Select your sd card and flash. 

## Start
To start using your kobo after the image of android got installed on the sd card follow this:
- Get the sd card out of the pc
- Reopen the kobo
- Put the sd card in the internal sd card slot
- Just turn it on

# Restore
If your device doesn't boot you need to restore the image you created in this step [Backup Image](https://github.com/lori28167/android-koboglo/blob/main/README.md)
If you didn't created it you're screwed and it's not my fault so you will need to use brain next time.
To restore it use the same image flasher you used to put android on the kobo sd card but instead of the android image select the one you created before doing the android flash.
